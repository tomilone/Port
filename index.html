        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Hello…</h3>
        <p>My name is Tony Milone and I’m a Full-Stack Web Developer who is currently based in the Chicagoland Area.</p>
        <p>I’m truly passionate about creating things, problem solving, and learning. Through my experiences in sports at a young age and in college, I learned the values of working on a team and growing with others.  Becoming a programmer is one of the ways that I’ve been able to put these passions together. I enjoy the constant challenges presented from coding, the process of working & learning with others to tackle those problems, & the satisfaction gained upon solving those problems. </p>
        <p>My primary tech stack currently includes Javascript, Node.js, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, some of my hobbies include: drawing, video games, music, coaching baseball, boxing, and spending time with my friends & family. </p>
        <p>Feel free to browse some of my projects and contact me by scrolling below!</p>

          <h2>Rick & Morty Jokes</h2>
          <p>
            My comedic take on an API hack project that implements the basic understanding of API's. The application spawns a random Rick & Morty character and tells a random (probably bad) dad joke.

          <h2>It Takes A Village</h2>
          <p>
            It Takes a Village is a community based altruism application that lets users notify their community that they are in need of assistance, be it food, clothing, transportation, etc. A user can post a story explaining what kind of help they are in need of, and other users in their real world "community" (based off geo-location proximity) can indicate whether they are able to provide aid, or can share to others in their off-app communities that might be able to help.
